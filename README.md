# Urban_Dictionary_and_Memes

## Project name :
Ultimate Urban Dictionary 

## Description: 

This application allows users to search for trendy and/or slang words to find their definitions and see their usage in context. When users search for words using the search box, two definitions are displayed as well as a meme associated with the word. Previous searches are stored in local storage and are listed on the page so that users can easily go back to previous terms they have already viewed.
